CALCULATOR

This calculator program is written in JAVA that utilizes the graphic user interface along
with performing a long list of operations. In order to program with a gui I imported several 
utilities like swing and awt event. I also extended WindowAdapter which is how I created my 
sixteen button frame. These buttons are tied to various methods that perform the required 
mathematical operations. The main is very clean with a simple call to create the object so 
that each method can be reused for other projects with similar calculations being performed.



BANK ACCOUNT, TELLER, CHECKING, SAVINGS

The bank account project was done in pieces as a true object oriented program. The original
object was BANKACCOUNT which was written in a way that operates independently.
The other objects were added later as the need for more options became apparent. 
This allowed me to create a program with maximum re-usability that is much easier
to troubleshoot than a procedurally written program. The comments are extensive and 
will thoroughly explain each step.



LOOPS LAB REVISED

Over the course of the semester I learned to program various and increasingly complex
loops that performed many tasks such as generating random numbers or a list of square 
numbers etc. After programming each of these individually I then wrote a program using 
one main to call each method, displaying what each does in the output.

WHILESQUARES - starts at 1 and generates a list of the first 10 square numbers a while loop

FORSQUARES   - starts at 1 and generates a list of the first 10 square numbers a for loop

WHILETIMES   - creates a time table grid from 1 -10 using a nested while loop

FORTIMES     - creates a time table grid from 1 -10 using a nested for loop

DOTWORANDOM  - generates two random numbers using a do while loop

DOLOTTERY    - generates six random and different numbers using a do while loop
